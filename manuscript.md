# Introduction

Peer review is widely considered to be fundamental in maintaining the rigour and validity of scholarly research. However, the process is often opaque, which can introduce bias into reporting standards for research and reduce the overall quality of the published record.

Presently, peer review is a non-standardised process, either across or within disciplines. Training and support is generally lacking, and it is often the case that reviewers, through no fault of their own, are unaware of the critical questions to be asking with respect to research design, methods, reporting, and analysis.

The aim of this project is to formulate a set of guidelines explicitly for reviewers in palaeontology journals, or multi-disciplinary journals that include palaeontology submissions. Through this, peer review can be more transparent and as objective as possible, representing a form of peer review best practice.

# Guidelines

Some of these points are adapted fromthe TTEE guidelines.

## General 

* Have any relevant funding sources been disclosed

* Have any relevant conflicts of interest been disclosed

* Have any previous versions of this work been indicated (e.g., preprints or pre-registrations)


## Abstract


## Introduction

* What type of study is this (e.g., replication, exploratory, meta-review)

* What is the primary purpose for conducting this study

* Is this part of a larger study, or a one-off

* What are the specific research questions addressed

* What is the scope of the study

## Methods

* When was this study started and for how long was its duration

### Data collection

* When were the data collected

* What were the conditions under which the data were collected or extracted

* Why was this study design selected

* Provide the precise details of data analysis, including information on software programs and packages, and annotated full code or set of commands.

* Are all information sources described, including accession dates

* Were data collected and vetted by all, some, or just one of the authors

* Were data obtained from previously published sources, or unpublished sources

* Is justification given for data that were ccollected but not including in the final analyses

* Were any assumptions, simplifications, or transformations to the data made

* Are any methods of weighting applied, and justifications for this given

* Are potential biases assessed and, if so, mitigated (e.g., publication bias, missing data, or selective reporting within studies)

* Complete and explicit database search terms including all logical connectors and operators sufficient to exactly duplicate search. Also, indicate all other sources of data (e.g. literature cited sections of published reviews, personal unpublished data, collaborative group project data available from cited sources or online).

* Are model selection criteria provided

### Involving fossil specimens

* If relevant, possible and allowable, deposit voucher specimens of the studied taxon/taxa in an appropriate curated collection 

* Are all analysed specimens available in a public and curated repository, and with accession numbers

* Were all relevant permits and permissions obtained to study specimens, and to publicise them

### Involving quantitative analysis

* What statistical tests were formed, and why were they chosen

* What is the total sample size

### Software environment

* Are all software and scripts identified, including their versions and availability

* Is the full model specification provided, including specific parameter choices and their justification

* Are all software and scripts available in a public repository and under an appropriate FOSS license

* Are code scripts appropriately annotated to faciliate easier understanding



## Results


### Involving quantitative analysis

* Are the full outcomes of statistical tests reported, including basic parameter estimates of central tendency (e.g., means), other basic estimates (e.g., regression and correlation coefficients), and variability (e.g., standard deviation) and associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g., confidence or credibility intervals)

* Are appropriate test statistics reported, including the degrees of freedom and p-values.

* For Bayesian analyses, this also should at a minimum include information on choice of priors and MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) settings (e.g. burn-in, the number of iterations, and thinning intervals). 


## Discussion

* Is the strength of the evidence evaluated and interpreted

* Are potential sources of bias, and their consequences, appropriately evaluated and interpreted
